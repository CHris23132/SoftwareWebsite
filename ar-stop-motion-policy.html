        <p>Privacy Policy for AR Stop Motion
            Effective Date: Sep 19 2024
            
            At AR Stop Motion, we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy explains how we manage your data when using our augmented reality (AR) app.
            
            1. No Data Collection
            AR Stop Motion is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or share any data. All functionalities of the app, including AR scene creation and video recording, are processed locally on your device. This means:
            
            We do not access or collect any personal data, recordings, or information from your device.
            All of your AR creations and interactions remain on your device and are not transmitted to any servers or third parties.
            2. Local Processing
            All processing for AR effects, object placement, and video recording happens entirely on your device. No cloud services are used, ensuring that your content and data stay private and secure.
            
            3. Paid Version (No Subscription)
            AR Stop Motion is a one-time paid app with no in-app purchases or subscriptions. Once you purchase the app, you have full access to all features. We do not process or store any payment information, as this is managed securely by the platform (Apple App Store or Google Play Store).
            
            4. Permissions
            To deliver a seamless AR experience, the app may request access to:
            
            Camera: For AR features and recording videos.
            Storage: To save your creations directly to your device.
            These permissions are used solely for app functionality and are never used to collect data.
            
            5. Safe & Fun Experience
            AR Stop Motion is a safe and private app designed for creative enjoyment. Since the app does not connect to any external services or third-party platforms, you can enjoy making AR movies without concerns about data privacy.
