        <p>Play 3D Privacy Policy
            Effective Date: Sep 19 2024
            
            At Play 3D, your privacy is our priority. We are committed to ensuring that your personal information remains secure and private while using our app. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data and explains that Play 3D operates locally on your device without collecting, storing, or sharing any personal information.
            
            1. Data Collection
            We do not collect any personal information or usage data while you use the Play 3D app. The app does not require you to create an account or provide any personal details, such as your name, email address, or location.
            
            2. Local Processing
            All data generated by the Play 3D app, including augmented reality (AR) interactions, animations, and recordings, is processed and stored locally on your device. This means that no information is transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties.
            
            3. Recordings and User-Generated Content
            Play 3D allows you to record your AR experiences, including video and audio. These recordings are stored locally on your device, and we do not have access to them. You have complete control over these files and can manage them directly from your device. The app does not upload or transmit any recordings to any external sources.
            
            4. Third-Party Services
            Play 3D does not use any third-party analytics tools, cloud services, or external data collection mechanisms. The app is entirely self-contained and does not integrate with external databases or third-party service providers.
            
            5. Permissions
            The app may request access to your device's camera, microphone, and storage to enable the AR features, recordings, and saving of your AR experiences. However, this access is strictly limited to the functionality of the app, and no data is sent outside of your device.
            
            6. Children's Privacy
            Play 3D is designed to be safe for users of all ages. As no personal information is collected or stored, the app complies with the privacy regulations protecting children's data, such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
            
            7. Data Security
            While Play 3D does not collect or store personal data, we take the security of your device and local data seriously. We recommend that users take appropriate measures to protect their devices, such as enabling passcodes and keeping software updated.
            
            8. Changes to This Policy
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how your privacy is protected.
